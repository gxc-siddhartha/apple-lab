# Basics of Design
## What is Design?

It is the process to visualise a problem for an approach to a successful solution.
## The Difference between Design and Drawing?

The difference between drawing and design is:

| Design | Drawing |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Done to approach a solution or to serve a purpose. | 1. Done unintentionally or for personal fulfilment. |
## What are design elements and design principles?

**Design Elements:** Design elements are the basic building blocks of a design from which the design is to be built.

**Design Principles:** Design principles are the rules and guidelines which govern the use of the “Design Elements” to produce an elegant design.

## Design Elements:

1. **Dot:** Dot is the basic element from which other elements such as line and shape are derived.
2. **Line:** Line can be defined as the collection of dots.
3. **Shape:** When we align a set of lines in a certain way we form a shape.
4. **Form:** It is a 3D figure that is formed using shapes.
5. **Colour:** To make a design more colourful and attractive we add colours to it.
6. **Value:** Value is the degree of darkness and brightness of a design.
7. **Texture:** It can be defined as the variation in the surface. Ex: A surface can be rough or smooth.
8. **Space:** It the canvas where the design is being drawn.
    1. *Negative:* Negative space is the space where there is no observable element available.
    2. *Positive:* Positive space is the space where an observable design is present.

## Design Principles:

1. **Alignment: Arrangement of elements in a particular sequence to avoid randomness.**
    1. Presence: Increases readability, improves the user experience (UX), provides better layout.
    2. Absence: Unorganised design, confusion, bad UX.
2. **Symmetry: Arranging elements to mirror each other.**
    1. Presence: Offers balance and harmony by mirroring elements evenly around a central axis. Also provides a sense of stability and formality.
    2. Absence: Asymmetricity can create dynamic and engaging design but might lead to a sense of imbalance or lack of sequence.
3. **Line: Line can help to bring direction and variation in a design. Line is an element and a principle.**
    1. Presence: Used to direct attention, create structure and movement within a design.
    2. Absence: Without a deliberate use of lines the design might lack direction and cause confusion.
4. **Transparency: Incorporating transparency in design allows layering and depth. It can create visual interest by revealing the elements behind (underlying elements).**
    1. Presence: makes the design more interesting by adding depth and layers.
    2. Absence: Flat or one-dimensional design, potentially making the design monotonous (boring) and hindering depth-perception (your ability to see objects in three dimensions).
5. **Movement:** This is used to create a sense of composition by making changes to element’s position, angle and size. This is also achieved using repetition of elements.
    1. Presence: Engages viewers attention and adds dynamism to the design.
    2. Absence: Lack engagement or fail to draw attention of the audience.
6. **Balance:** This involves distributing the elements evenly along the design to facilitate formality. Balance can be radial, asymmetrical and symmetrical.
    1. Symmetrical: One-half of the design is an exact mirror of the other.
    2. Asymmetrical: The weight is the same, but arrangement might be different.
    3. Radial: Elements are arranged along a centre point and are separated with equal angles.
    4. Presence: Distributes visual weight evenly, ensuring stability and harmony.
    5. Absence: Imbalance can cause discomfort or lead to unintended focus on elements.
7. **Emphasis:** This principle highlights the focus point or the most important part of an element in a design. It helps draw attention and guides the user.
    1. Presence: Highlights the key element and provides the context of the content.
    2. Absence: Confusion in understanding the important elements, misguidance.
8. **Contrast:** It refers to highlighting certain elements to make them stand out from the rest of the similar ones. Contrast can be achieved through colours, size, typography, shape, effects, etc.
    1. Presence: Creates visual interest by highlighting differences, aiding readability.
    2. Absence: Results in monotonous design.
9. **Hierarchy:** Establishes an order of importance and helps in categorising the content and understanding it by prioritisation.
    1. Presence: Organises content
    2. Absence: Confusing content distribution, hindered UX
10. **Scale:** Refers to the relative size of the element. Playing with scale can emphasise elements and adds depth to some extent.
    1. Presence: Defines the relationship between the elements.
    2. Absence: Leads to flat and uninteresting design.
11. **Proportion:** refers to the harmonious relationship and balance between different elements in a composition. It involves the appropriate distribution of sizes and quantities to create visual equilibrium and aesthetic appeal.
    1. Presence: Ensure elements relate harmoniously in size and scale, contributing to a visually pleasing composition.
    2. Absence: Incorrect proportions can lead to a disproportionate and hindered design.
12. **Proximity:** Grouping related elements together to create a connection and visual relationship between elements. It helps in organising information the design provides.
    1. Presence: Groups related elements together and primarily adds organisation and formality to the design.
    2. Absence: Lack of proximity can cause confusion and make it difficult to adapt the content and design.
13. **Perspective:** Perspective is used to represent a 2 dimensional into 3 dimensions. We change the angle, position, size or any other property to achieve the required outcome.
    1. Presence: Adds depth and dimension to the design
    2. Absence: The design feels flat and often lack a sense a realism.
14. **Spacing:** It is a technique to manage the gap or space between the elements to make the design more readable and appealing to look at.
    1. Presence: Provides a breathing room between the elements.
    2. Absence: Insufficient and excessive spacing leads to unethical design.
15. **Redundancy:** The intelligent use of repetitiveness in a design of the elements to increase the overall functionality and accessibility of the design.
    1. Presence: Improved user experience and facilitates faster access to important things.
    2. Absence: Unethical use of redundancy can create hinderance and difficulty to identify elements. It can cause confusion.
16. **Depth:** It is the process of giving the elements of a design a sense of depth by using effects, shapes and proportions.
    1. Presence: It helps in making the design multi-layered and dynamic.
    2. Absence: Design looks flat and uninteresting.
17. **Grid:** This principle plays a primary role in aligning the items on the canvas correctly with the help of squares and rectangles. The grid can imagined as a grid paper for graph plotting in mathematics.
    1. Presence: Adds formality by providing alignment and symmetry.
    2. Absence: Lack of grid might make the design look unorganised.
18. **Variety:** Variety is a concept of making the same element look different by making changes to it’s shape, colour and size for the purpose of categorisation or creativity.
    1. Presence: Introduces diversity and creativeness.
    2. Absence: Design looks monotonous and flat.
19. **Unity**: Unity is principle which states that the elements of a design must be the derivatives of a primary ancestor (can be a colour, font or any other element). Example: `A website of a brand contains the shades of the colour that the brand has as it’s identity.`
    1. Presence: Ensures that all the elements look connected.
    2. Absence: Lead to randomness.
20. **Frame:** This principle is used to bring the attention of the user to a particular content or element in a design.
    1. Presence: Provides guidance.
    2. Absence: Without framing the design might lack structure.

## The Colour Wheel:

### Primary Colors:

These are the three colors that all other colors are made from: blue, yellow, and red.

### Secondary Colors:

These are made by combining two primary colors. They are located between the primary colors on the color wheel. Examples include orange (red and yellow), green (blue and yellow), and purple (blue and red).

### Tertiary Colors:

These are made by mixing a primary color with the secondary color next to it. Examples include yellow-orange, red-orange, red-purple, blue-purple, blue-green, and yellow-green.

### Warm and Cool Colors:

## Color Schemes:

### Hue

This is the pure colour itself.

1. **Tint:** A tint is created by adding white to a pure color. This lightens the color, making it softer and often pastel-like. Tints are essentially variations of a color with increased lightness.
2. **Shade:** A shade is produced by adding black to a pure color. This darkens the color, resulting in a deeper, more muted version. Shades convey a sense of richness and depth.
3. **Tone:** A tone is achieved by adding both black and white (gray) to a pure color. This alters the intensity or saturation of the color without significantly changing its lightness. Tones are often more subdued and muted than the original color.

### The R.G.B. and The Y.M.C.K

1. **RGB (Red, Green, Blue):**
    - **Definition:** RGB is an additive color model used in electronic displays, such as computer monitors, television screens, and digital cameras. In this model, colors are created by combining various intensities of red, green, and blue light. When these colors are combined at full intensity, they produce white light.
    - **Usage:** RGB is well-suited for digital devices and screens, and it is the standard color model for web design, digital photography, and anything displayed on electronic screens.
2. **CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black):**
    - **Definition:** CMYK is a subtractive color model used in color printing. Colors are created by subtracting varying percentages of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black inks. The more colors are added, the darker the result. In this model, combining all four inks should ideally produce a deep black.
    - **Usage:** CMYK is the standard color model for color printing, including magazines, brochures, and other printed materials. It is particularly suitable for processes where colors are layered or printed on top of each other.
